/**
Scalding Tutorial ported to use the Type-safe API (TDsl)
(rather than Cascading's Fields API). The examples here roughly correspond
to those in `tutorial/Tutorial{0..5}.scala`.

These tutorials are all run from this single file; which one is run can
be chosen with a command-line flag "--tutorial". For instance, to run the
first tutorial example:

> ./scripts/scald.rb --local tutorial/TypedTutorial.scala \
      --tutorial 0 \
      --input tutorial/data/hello.txt \
      --output tutorial/data/output0.txt \
      --words tutorial/data/word_scores.tsv

(Note: only tutorial 5 uses "word_scores.tsv")

      // the lower case words), and the counts (Long).

      // Note: To do more interesting aggregations, Scalding supports
      // a variety of operations, such as `sum`, `reduce`, `foldLeft`,
      // `mapGroup`, etc, that can all be applied efficiently on Monoids

    Interoperability with Fields API
    --------------------------------
    Scalding also provides a thinner, un-type-safe wrapper over Cascading
    which is known as the Fields API because each record has a number of
    named "fields".

    Most jobs can be done completely in the Typed API, but for compatibility,
    there are ways to go back and forth between the two schemes, which the
    next couple cases demonstrate.

    Bonus: Typed blocks
    -------------------
    An alternative to working completely in typed mode is to use
    `typed` blocks, which create a TypedPipe within the scope, and then
    map the output back into an untyped Pipe. You specify the fields to
    map in and out using the `->` pair passed to `typed()`.
