/**
  * lookupJoin simulates the behavior of a realtime system attempting
  * to leftJoin (K, V) pairs against some other value type (JoinedV)
  * by performing realtime lookups on a key-value Store.
  *
  * An example would join (K, V) pairs of (URL, Username) against a
  * service of (URL, ImpressionCount). The result of this join would
  * be a pipe of (ShortenedURL, (Username,
  * Option[ImpressionCount])).
  *
  * To simulate this behavior, lookupJoin accepts pipes of key-value
  * pairs with an explicit time value T attached. T must have some
  * sensical ordering. The semantics are, if one were to hit the
  * right pipe's simulated realtime service at any time between
  * T(tuple) T(tuple + 1), one would receive Some((K,
  * JoinedV)(tuple)).
  *
  * The entries in the left pipe's tuples have the following
  * meaning:
  *
  * T: The the time at which the (K, W) lookup occurred.
  * K: the join key.
  * W: the current value for the join key.
  *
  * The right pipe's entries have the following meaning:
  *
  * T: The time at which the "service" was fed an update
  * K: the join K.
  * V: value of the key at time T
  *
  * Before the time T in the right pipe's very first entry, the
  * simulated "service" will return None. After this time T, the
  * right side will return None only if the key is absent,
  * else, the service will return Some(joinedV).
