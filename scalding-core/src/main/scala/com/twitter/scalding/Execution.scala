/**
 * Execution[T] represents and computation that can be run and
 * will produce a value T and keep track of counters incremented
 * inside of TypedPipes using a Stat.
 *
 * Execution[T] is the recommended way to compose multistep computations
 * that involve branching (if/then), intermediate calls to remote
 * services, file operations, or looping (e.g. testing for convergence).
 *
 * Library functions are encouraged to implement functions from
 * TypedPipes or ValuePipes to Execution[R] for some result R.
 * Refrain from calling run in library code. Let the caller
 * of your library call run.
 *
 * Note this is a Monad, meaning flatMap composes in series as you expect.
 * It is also an applicative functor, which means zip (called join
 * in some libraries) composes two Executions is parallel. Prefer
 * zip to flatMap if you want to run two Executions in parallel.
