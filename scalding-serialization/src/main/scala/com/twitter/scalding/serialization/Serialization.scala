 * need to do key sorting for partitioning.
 *
 * This serialization typeclass must serialize equivalent objects
 * identically to be lawful. Serialization should be the same
 * on all JVMs run at any time, in other words, Serialization is a
 * pure function. Given that constraint, we can always
 * get an Equiv and Hashing from a Serialization (by doing byte-wise
 * equivalence or byte-wise hashing).
 *
 * A serialization always gives a hash because one can just
 * serialize and then hash the bytes. You might prefer another
 * implementation. This must satisfy:
 *   (!equiv(a, b)) || (hash(a) == hash(b))
