# Lingual integration with Scalding

Makes working with Lingual in Scalding much simpler. 
It abstracts away the need to work directly with Cascading and allows for one job to run both Scalding and Lingual.

Note.  For now only support flat objects. Nested structures such as thrift in queries should be possible but will require more work.

Some examples of how to use the library in the Tutorial directory.
